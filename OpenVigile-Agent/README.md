# OpenVigile - Agent üïµÔ∏è

An agent usually resides on the same instance as the signal source. Agents ensure reliable, consistent and secure communication of data from the observed instance to the OpenVigile Collector Stack. We utilize Grafana agents with configurations provided by the OpenVigile Wizard and API for most of the use cases. It streamlines and automates the process of downloading, configuring and deploying an agent.

### OpenVigile Agent offers:
- Faster installation and deployment
- OpenTelemetry OTLP data format
- Multiple injestions and exports simultaneously
- Pre-baked configurations
- Interactive GUI for modifying configurations (Wizard)
