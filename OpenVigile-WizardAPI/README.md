# OpenVigile - WizardAPI ðŸ–§

The Wizard API creates and delivers configuration and installation files necessary for the Single-Command and Interactive Wizard installation of the OpenVigile stack. It is capable of generating for bash scripts, docker-compose and config files for a wide range of use cases, with custom ports, signal types and other configuration choices. It is what provides a quick setup process to the rather complex structure of OpenVigile stack. The Wizard API complements the Wizard Frontend.

### Installation
It follows the standard NodeJS installation:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file taking reference from the `.env-sample` file
3. Start server
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
